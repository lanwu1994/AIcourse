The files *.lp contain the base code for the programming assignments of
the 5th round of the AI course. The directory instances/ contains some
test instances for graph coloring and Sudoku. No instances are provided
for the other two problems. Their evaluation is based on increasing
the parameter value involved in the problem.

Once completed these files can be uploaded for grading at MyCourses.
At most 50 submissions are allowed for each assignments.

We strongly recommend to use/install Clingo (= Gringo + Clasp) for
testing purposes. You can find the latest versions from
notebooks.csc.fi (see directory clingo/ therein) or, alternatively,
from https://potassco.org/. The Clingo embedded at MyCourses is
subject to resource bounds and thus it is suboptimal for
debugging. Also, there may be delays with the evaluation and, in
particular, if 400 students start to heavily use the embedded version.
