The files *.lp contain the base code for the programming assignments of
the 5th round of the AI course. The directory instances/ contains some
test instances for graph coloring and Sudoku. No instances are provided
for the other two problems. Their evaluation is based on increasing
the parameter value involved in the problem.

We strongly recommend to use/install Clingo (= Gringo + Clasp) for
testing purposes. You can find the latest versions from
notebooks.csc.fi (see directory clingo/ therein) or, alternatively,
from https://potassco.org/.
